# Python-Fundamentals
I made this repo so that I can brush up on my Python basics and hopefully improve at it.

I plan on trying out and working on projects with Python in the future

- Exercise 2
  - Increment while loop
  - Decrement while loop

- Challenge 1
  - Write the code to implement a number guessing game 
- Challenge 2
  - Write the code to implement an improved num guessing game

## 7. Python-lists
- Exercise 1
  - Create a list of values
  - Empty list
  - Use an index to access individual elements
  - Create a slice
  - Reverse and sort list
  - Treat the list like a queue a list
  - Combine a new list with an existing list
  - Clear all items from a list

- Exercise 2
  - Test a value for inclusion in a list
  - Loop through the List
  - Break out a for loop

  - Create nested for loops
  - Choose randomly from a list 

- Challenge
  - Deal a deck of cards to players 

## 8. Python-functions 
- Exercise 1
  - Add code to the code file to create and call a small function
  - Update the code from the previous step and add code to accept an input parameter
  - Modify the function call to leave out the argument
  - Update the code example to include a 2nd optional input parameter
    - Add a new function that returns a value
    - Add a new function that returns a list
    - Add a new function that demonstrates variable scope in a function

- Exercise 2
  - Using *args and **kwargs

- Exercise 3
